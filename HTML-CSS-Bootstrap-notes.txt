Lets wait for another 3-4 min. Once we have the expected strength i 
shall begin today's session.

CSS
=> Cascading Style sheet.
=> Adding style to HTML Document.
=> You can implement CSS in 3 different ways, namely:
    Inline
        We impelment the CSS Styling on the opening tag of a HTML 
        Element.
    Internal
        We impelment the CSS Styling inside the Head Element within 
        the HTML Document.
    External
        We impelment the CSS Styling in a separate page and link it
        to the HTML Document.

Selectors
    These are used to select the HTML Element so that we can implement
    styles on them.
    3 types of Selectors
        Element Selector name of the element
            Eg: p, h1, body, etc....
        ID Selector # symbol
            we create a id attribute inside the HTML Element. Then
            the id_name is used to implement the styles
        Class Selector  . symbol
            we create a class attribute inside the HTML Element. Then
            the class_name is used to implement the styles

Dimensions
Property => Height and width
Values => auto, px/%/cm/em/rem, inherit
max-height => It sets the maximum height that a HTML Element can have.
min-height => It sets the minimum height that a HTML Element can have.
max-width  => It sets the maximum width  that a HTML Element can have.
min-width  => It sets the minimum width  that a HTML Element can have.

display
=> Every HTML Element will have default display settings.

display: inline;
display: block

display: none;
    //The element will not be reflected in the HTML Body 
visible
    Visibility: hidden;
    //The Element will not be reflected but it will occupy some space
    inside the HTML Body

Background
=> color
=> image url("image_location")
=> repeat no-repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y
Homework - Do it Yourself[DIY]
=> attachment
=> position 

19/Sep/2021

CSS Box Model 
    => Layout and the design based on the content.

content => text/images/anything.                => Content insode the Element
Padding => It is the area around the content.   => Inside the Element 
border  => It is the area which is in between padding and Margin => On the Element 
Margin  => Outermost area of the content is the border. => Ouside the Element 

Inline = Internal = External
       => Inside the Head.
            Based on where the Internal and External data are present the precedence will 
            take care.
First Precedence will be for the inline then it will be for the Internal and later it will
be for External.

Selectors
    => class
    => ID
    => Element

Border 
    width
    color
    style
        solid, dashed, dotted, hidden, double, ridge, etc....

Margin
    top 
    right
    bottom
    left

margin: top right bottom left;  //shortcut property and order cannot be changed.
margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;

Padding
    top

    left

Padding: top right bottom left;
Padding: 0px 0px 5px 5px;    //shortcut property and order cannot be changed.

Before Bootstrap came into existance we were using CSS Media Queries.

Bootstrap
=> It is a Framework [Collection of library's]
=> This libraries has predefined styles and predefined scripts in it.
=> Every Predefined Styles & Scripts are accessed by a class name.
=> Even the class names are also predefined.
=> Made up of HTML, CSS and JS
=> Helps us to create responsive websites easily.
=> responsive means adapting itself to diff screen size.

=> Bootstrap framework has 3 files which are required.
1 is css file and 2 are javascript file.

Include Bootstrap in HTML
Method 1: Using CDN 
          The Framework is hosted by some one else. And we simply
          link those files to our project.
Method 2: Downloading the Framework and Manually linking it with our 
          project
            Homework
                => bootstrap.min.css
                => bootstrap.min.Js

Containers
=> Its a wrapper which wraps all the elements together into a single
body.
=> 2 types, namely:
1) .container
    responsive fixed width container, left and right some space will be
    there.
2) .container-fluid
    responsive but it occupies all the width.

Grid System.
=> Visualize TV, laptop, tab, watch
width = Varies
height = constant.
=> Grid system helps us in managing the width of the screen
HOW ?
Based on a concept called as Grid.
=> width = columns
=> height = rows

TV
10 columns
10 rows

Tab
5 columns
But the rows are divided into 2 parts.
10 rows only

=> The grid system of bootstrap follows or allows only 12 columns in 
a row.
=> We have another 5 sub classess for row and col, namely
1) xs   extra small => screen size < 768px
2) sm   small       => 768 px < screen size < 992 px
3) md   medium      => 992px < screensize < 1200 px 
4) lg   large       => screensize > 1200 px
5) xlg extra large  => its a guess probably more than 1400 px.

Syntax: col-xs or row-xs

=> Manupilation of number of columns in a single row using the 
following syntax i.e.
col-xs-number  or row-xs-number

row - 12 columns
    col 3rd parameter which will help us to tell the size of the col

NavBar = Navigation Bar/menu

=> These is placed at the top of the page.
=> The following classes are used namely:
1) .NavBar  => class used to implement Navbar using bootstrap
2) .navbar-default  or .navbar-inverse => 
3) .navbar-header   => wrapper class for brand and nav class 
4) .navbar-brand => Used with Logos
4) .navbar-nav  => Used with Menu Items 

<div class="container">
      <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-md navbar-danger bg-danger">
        <div class="container-fluid">
          <ul class="navbar-nav">
            <li class="nav-item">e !</li>
            <li class="nav-item">Login</li>
            <li class="nav-item">Create a Account</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </div>

Flex
=> To manage the layout or alignment or providing size to grid columns,
etc...
=> syntax starts with the letter D
d stands for display

d-flex => width will be 100% irrespective of the text size 
d-inline-flex => width is occupied based on the text.

Manupilate the directions of the flex
On Row Level
1) flex-row => normal left to right directions
2) flex-row-reverse => right to left direction 

<div class="d-flex bg-warning">I am d-flex example</div>
    <div class="d-inline-flex bg-success">I am d-flex example</div>
    <div class="d-flex flex-row-reverse">
      <div class="p-2 bg-warning">Number 1</div>
      <div class="p-2 bg-warning">Number 2</div>
      <div class="p-2 bg-warning">Number 3</div>
    </div>

On Column Level
1) flex-col => normal left to right directions
2) flex-col-reverse => right to left direction 

On row Level
1) flex-row => normal left to right directions
2) flex-row-reverse => right to left direction 

Justify content = right to left/left to right
=> Provides the alignment to the content.
=> Sub properties are as follows, namely:
start, end, center, between, around & evenly

<div class="d-flex justify-content-start">
    <div class="p-2 bg-warning">Number 1</div>
    <div class="p-2 bg-warning">Number 2</div>
    <div class="p-2 bg-warning">Number 3</div>
</div>
123
    123
  123
1  2  3
 1 2 3 
    
align-items => top to bottom/bottom to top
=> flex, align in x axis or in y axis.
start 
end
center
stretch
<div height:400px background-color: grey>
<div class="d-flex align-items-start flex-row mb-3" style="height: 200px;">
    <div class="p-2 bg-warning">Number 1</div>
    <div class="p-2 bg-warning">Number 2</div>
    <div class="p-2 bg-warning">Number 3</div>
</div>
</div>

dropdown
=> select tag and option tag in HTML
=> We can include some scripts and styles using the dropdown in B.S 
dropdown
dropdown-menu 
dropdown-item
btn 
dropdown-toggle
btn-colors

<div class="dropdown">
    <button class="btn btn-danger dropdown-toggle">

        <li class="dropdown-item">Number 2</li>
        <li class="dropdown-item">Number 3</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Collapse
=> JS Plugin => It is a part of predefined script
=> We use them as a trigger to perform some specific task.

collapse class
collapsing class
collapse.show class
<head><style>.myclass{ @include transition($transition-collapse)} </style></html>

<a class="btn btn-success" href="#mycollapse" data-bs-toggle="collapse">Click Here For Trigger</a>
