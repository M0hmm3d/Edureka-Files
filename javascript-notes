Module -1 Introduction to Javascript

- it is a scripting language.
- it is used to provide dynamic content to the HTML Document
- The DYnamic here refers to the Behaviour of your HTML tags.
- The JS was derived from a Scripting language known as ECMAScript (European Computer's Manufacturing Association)
- ECMAS was launched in the year 1997 - at the time of introduction JS was merely a procedure oriented scripting language.
- A fifth Version called as ECMAScript5 was a major change since they converted the Procedure Oriented JS into Object Oriented JS - 2009
  Procedure Oriented - C

  - function based
  - top to bottom approach
  - No Inheritance concepts

  Object Oriented - C++, Java, Python, etc......

  - Object based
  - Bottom up approach
  - Inheritance Concepts

- Typescript is the mother of JS + ES5 + ES6 + Some more extra features
- Even though Typescript is better even today the ts is actually converted into js and then only the browser executes it.
- AngularJS - first version - Javascript
- Angular - second version onwards - Typescript

php is also scripting lang - Can be used only in Back End
js is also a scripting lang - Initially it was used in the Front End but after 2009 it was also used in Back End

- A sixth Version - major update - it supported most of the object oriented concepts - 2015

Structure of Javascript

- The structure is simply we access the Html tag and change the behaviour.

HTML ELEMENT = Opening tag + Content + Closing tag
innerHTML means Content
//HTML

<p id="myid">Hello I am India</p>

//Script
document.getElementById("myid").innerHTML = "Hello I am Srilanka"

After the intorduction of node, JS can be used in front end as well as back end in the web application

Module 2- How to Integrate JS with HTML Document - 3 Types

- Internal = Inside the Head Tag
- Inline = Inside the HTMl ELement called as Script
- External = A seperate JS File and we link it inside the body of the html document

//Function without any parameter or any return data.
function func_name(){
//statements
}

//Function with parameter but without any return data.
function func_name(parameters....){
//statements parameters will be used here
}

//Function with parameter and return data.
return_type function func_name(parameters....){
//return statements parameters will be used here
}

In JS we use // to comment !!!

Module 3 - Variables in JS

- Variables are nothing but a name that is given to a memory location
- Inside the memory location we will store the data/value.
- In jS we have 3 ways to declare a variable, namely
  DataTypes values datatype_value

1. var - Yes Yes
2. let - Yes No
   The let keyword allows us to declare a variable which will have constant name but different values
3. const- No No
   The constant keyword allows us to declare a constant which will have a constant value and name.

Naming Convention to be followed while declaring a variable name

1. The var name must begin with a character i.e alphabet
2. The var can also begin with \_ and $
3. Apart from the first character any other characters can be number or it can be \_ or it can be $ or even alphabets
4. The var name is case sensitive

Datatypes in JS

- The type of the value/data that is stored inside a variable.
- 5 Major types of datatypes

1. number
   real, decimal, etc...
2. string
   Anything enclosed inside a single quote ot double quote
3. boolean
   true or false
4. undefined
5. object
   {name: "Raghu"}

typeof - This keyword is used to tell us what is the datatype of the value

Operators in JS

- The Operators are used to tell the computer how to process the data.
- There are mainly of 5 types:

1. Arithematic Operators
   - - - / \*\* % ++ --
2. Relational/Comparision Operators
   == != > < >= <= === !===
3. Logical Operators
   && || ! with && ! with ||
4. Bitwise Operators
   & | ~ ^ << >>
5. Assignment Operators
   = += -= \*= /= %= \*\*= &= |=
6. type Operators
   typeof
